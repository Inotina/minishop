# minishop
This project is my training with Servlet API, MVC Pattern, Maven and testing my base knowledges of SQL, HTML5, CSS3, JSP and JSTL. I implemented internet shop functionality:
1. Cart(client side stored, server side actions)
2. Purchase(will be checked and added to db)
3. Register, Login and Logout modules.
4. Admin Area to manage products and purchases.

I'm sure the code is not so great and clean but it works :)
