# minishop
This project(Eclipse Maven webapp archetype project) is my training with Servlet API, MVC Pattern, Maven and testing my knowledges of SQL, HTML5, CSS3, JSP and JSTL. I've implemented internet shop functionality:
1. Cart(client side stored, server side actions)
2. Purchase(will be checked and added to db)
3. Register, Login and Logout modules.
4. Admin Area to manage products and purchases.

I'm sure the code is not so great and clean but it works :)
